This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.ie.vat module. It
tries to cover more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.ie import pps


Extra tests for length checking and corner cases:

>>> pps.validate('111222333')  # check number should contain letters
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...

>>> pps.validate('1234567ABC')  # too long
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...

>>> pps.validate('1234567XX')  # invalid letters
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...


The validate() function should check with old & new formats

>>> validate('6433435F')  # pre-2013
'6433435F'
>>> validate('6433435FW')  # pre-2013 format for married women
'6433435FW'
>>> validate('6433435E')  # incorrect check digit
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidChecksum: ...

>>> validate('6433435OA')  # 2013 format (personal)
'6433435OA'
>>> pps.validate('1234567FA')
'1234567FA'
>>> validate('6433435IH')  # 2013 format (non-personal)
'6433435IH'
>>> pps.validate('1234567WH')
'1234567WH'
>>> pps.validate('1234567OB') # 2013 format 2024 B-range 
'1234567OB'
>>> validate('6433435VH')  # 2013 format (incorrect check)
Traceback (most recent call last):
